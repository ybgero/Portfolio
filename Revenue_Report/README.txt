📊 Interactive Revenue Intelligence Dashboard (Fun with Fictional Stats)
✅ Project Summary
Built in Power BI as a personal side project, this dashboard explores revenue performance across four countries — China, France, Germany, and India — with the ability to toggle between Store Type, Product Category, and Customer Income Group.
What makes it fun?
👉 All the data is entirely made up. So the insights are as entertaining as they are “informative.”

🔄 Key Features
* Dynamic parameter control to switch views by store type, income, or product.

* A metric toggle to view either:

   * Total Revenue

   * Year-over-Year Growth Rate

      * Sleek visual layout with horizontal bar charts for easy cross-country comparisons.

      * Built using Power BI’s DAX, slicers, and clean UX design principles.

🤯 Fun “Insights” That Aren’t Real
         * Germany’s supermarkets dominate, selling more than France and China combined.

         * France’s high-income customers love their gourmet supermarkets — .

         * A -30.18% YoY decline sounds alarming, but don’t worry — the economy of this imaginary world is resilient.

🌱 What I Learned (Besides How to Make Up Stats)
            * Built parameter-based visuals to switch dimensions on the fly.

            * Practiced advanced DAX measures and interactive UX in Power BI.

            * Learned that designing a dashboard is as much about storytelling as it is about data.

            * Had fun using fake numbers to create a dashboard that feels real. 




TAKEAWAY : EVEN THOUGH THE DATA IS FAKE, THE CHALLENGES WERE REAL
