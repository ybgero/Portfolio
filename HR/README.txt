📊 HR Analytics Dashboard — Power BI
👋 Introduction
In a world where people are a company’s greatest asset, HR teams need more than static reports — they need insight at a glance. I built this HR Analytics Dashboard to turn raw employee data into decision-ready intelligence, helping HR leaders track hiring, retention, performance, and diversity with clarity and confidence.
This dashboard was designed not just to report numbers, but to tell a story — with visuals that highlight what’s working, and where action is needed.

🎯 Purpose
This dashboard empowers HR stakeholders to:
* Monitor hiring trends and time-to-hire performance

* Track employee performance and absenteeism over time

* Understand and reduce employee turnover

* Analyze diversity and representation in hiring and attrition

Each insight is enhanced with trend indicators, color-coded signals, and time-based comparisons like:
“How did we do this quarter vs last quarter?”
“Is our turnover rate going up or down?”
“Are we hiring faster or slower compared to before?”
