ðŸŒŸ NovaMart Dashboard Project: Storyline

ðŸ§© Context
NovaMart, a retail company with a diverse product catalog (Apparel, Electronics, Home Essentials), operates across four regions in India. They were struggling with scattered reporting and outdated Excel-based tracking â€” limiting visibility across performance, profitability, and customer behavior.


ðŸŽ¯ Objective
NovaMart brought me on board to:

Centralize key performance metrics

Build an interactive, scalable Power BI dashboard

Enable data-driven decisions across sales, marketing, and operations

Create stakeholder-specific views (e.g., regional managers, finance, category heads)

ðŸ”§ My Role
Integrated and cleaned data from multiple sources (Sales, Orders, Customers)

Built a central financial dashboard using Power BI

Created a retention-focused model to analyze returning customers

Used measures and DAX to track profit, margin, retention, quantity sold, and more

Added forecast vs. budget variance tracking (Delta CF & Delta B) to highlight performance gaps

Designed stakeholder-specific dashboards for category heads, regional managers, and executives

ðŸ“Š Key Insights From the Dashboard
1. Profitability Breakdown
Electronics dominates profits across all regions (~22% margin)

Apparel is underperforming with negative profits across the board

Home Essentials shows steady, low-margin profits with the highest customer retention

2. Customer Retention Trends
Overall customer retention sits at ~75%, led by Home Essentials

Apparel lags in retention and sales consistency, pointing to a potential product or pricing issue

3. Regional Performance
The East region generated the highest overall profit and sales volume

The South region shows higher-than-average retention, suggesting stronger loyalty campaigns or better service

Profitability challenges are consistent across Apparel in every region

4. Order and Quantity Behavior
Balanced order distribution (~20,000 total)

~51K products sold overall, with Electronics slightly leading in quantity

ðŸ§ª Forecast vs. Budget Analysis (Delta CF, Delta B)
Built dynamic measures using random variation to simulate Budget (Delta B) and Forecast (Delta CF) comparisons

Added visual alerts to flag where actuals deviate from expected performance

This helps stakeholders course-correct proactively

ðŸ“¦ Stakeholder Dashboards
Each department now gets a tailored view:


Stakeholder	Dashboard Focus
Executive Team	High-level KPIs, profit margins, retention, budget vs actual
Category Heads	Profit by category/region, customer satisfaction, discounts
Regional Managers	Sales vs orders by region, customer retention, logistics
Marketing	Retention trends, top-selling products, campaign performance
These dashboards refresh automatically and support self-service exploration using slicers and filters.

ðŸ’¡ Value Delivered
Shifted NovaMart from reactive to proactive decision-making

Unified their reporting on a single platform

Improved stakeholder engagement by making data accessible and relevant
